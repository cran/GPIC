#' @section Guidelines: GPIC index reflects both the quantity and quality of
#'   prizes that a group of participants obtained in individual competitions.
#'   Call \code{\link{vec2idx}} and \code{\link{df2idx}} to compute GPIC index
#'   for a single group and multiple groups, respectively. The results of
#'   Vietnamese National Olympiads are provided as sample datasets
#'   \code{\link{vno}} and \code{\link{vnomath}}.
